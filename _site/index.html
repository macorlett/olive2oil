			<h2>About us</h2>
			<p>
			Olive2oil is a premium, award winning Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO). It is produced by 
			the careful blending of oil from the olives from several varieties of olive tress.The trees are 
			predominately of the Italian origin and grown in the fertile soils of Tauherenikau in the 
			Southern Wairarapa. Olive2oil carries the <a href="http://www.olivesnz.org.nz/certification-the-olive-mark/" target="_blank">Olives New Zealand OliveMark</a> certifying that it meets 
			the bottling, labeling, chemical and sensory criteria of EVOO. These criteria are based on 
			international Olive Council standards for EVOO.
